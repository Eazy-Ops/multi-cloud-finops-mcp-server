üåê **FastMCP - Multi-Cloud FinOps Copilot**

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects Gemini-powered assistants with FinOps insights across AWS, GCP, and Azure. Perform natural language-based cost breakdowns, audits, and usage summaries ‚Äî all locally and securely.

---

## üìå Why Use FastMCP?

Managing multi-cloud costs is complex. FastMCP allows you to:

* Ask AI "How much did we spend on Azure last month?"
* Run a cost-saving audit across AWS and GCP in one prompt
* Receive budget summaries from all major cloud providers

Powered by **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **Gemini Pro**, this tool makes FinOps conversational and cross-platform.

## üß± Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.11+
* poetry
* CLI tools:

  * aws CLI (for AWS)
  * gcloud CLI (for GCP)
  * az CLI (for Azure)

### 2. Clone & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eazy-Ops/multi-cloud-finops-mcp-server.git
cd multi-cloud-finops-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# activate virtualenv created by poetry
poetry shell
```

---

## üîê Authentication Setup

### üîπ AWS

```bash
aws configure --profile your-profile
```

You'll be prompted for:

* Access Key ID
* Secret Access Key
* Region
* Output format (e.g. json)

### üîπ GCP

**Option 1: Use Application Default Credentials (ADC)**

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

**Option 2: Use Service Account JSON**

Pass the file path to `service_account_key_path` when calling GCP functions.

### üîπ Azure

```bash
az login
```

**For service principal auth (optional):**

```bash
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

---

## üß™ Usage

### CLI Entry Point

```bash
poetry run python -m mcp.server.fastmcp
```
### üîπ OR
```bash
python main.py
```

Then ask questions in Claude Desktop, Amazon Q, or any MCP-compatible client:

* "Run a FinOps audit for AWS us-east-1 profile"
* "Get last 30 days GCP cost breakdown for my service account"
* "How many stopped Azure VMs in west-europe?"

## üí¨ Example Prompts

### üìä Azure quick network analysis for subscription_id id

```bash
OK. I've analyzed the Azure network resources for subscription ID 8a4e83d9-b1b3-485f-a7d1-0aab11284c12 and found some cost optimization opportunities:                                                                  ‚îÇ

‚îÇ  ‚Ä¢ Expensive NAT Gateways: The NAT Gateway testNAT in centralus has low usage. Consider replacing it with a NAT VM for cost savings, using Service Endpoints where possible, or reviewing if NAT is actually needed.    ‚îÇ


‚îÇ  ‚Ä¢ Idle Load Balancers: The load balancer v2-api-lb in westus has had no traffic in the last 30 days.  It's recommended to delete it, but ensure no critical services depend on it before doing so.                     ‚îÇ

‚îÇ  ‚Ä¢ Unused Public IPs: Several public IPs are not associated with any resources and can be deleted to avoid unnecessary costs. These include testIPforNAT, DBA-VPN-PRITUNL-ip, OpenVPN-ip, DBA-VM-01-ip, DBA-VM-02-ip,   ‚îÇ
‚îÇ    DBA-VM-04-ip, DBAVM03ip245, DBA-QM-STAGE-ip, and QM-LOGS-ip.  Remember, Azure charges for unassociated public IPs.                                                                                                   ‚îÇ

‚îÇ This analysis includes details about Load Balancers, NAT Gateways, Network Security Groups (NSGs), and Public IPs.  Notably, there are no unused NSGs identified in this analysis.  The detailed information about each ‚îÇ
‚îÇ resource, including its location, SKU, and tags, is available in the raw output if you need to dive deeper.

## üß™ Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests for all cloud provider tools. Tests are organized by cloud provider and cover both success and error handling scenarios.

### Running Tests

#### Run All Tests
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

#### Run Tests for Specific Cloud Provider

**AWS Tests:**
```bash
python run_tests.py aws
```

**GCP Tests:**
```bash
python run_tests.py gcp
```

**Azure Tests:**
```bash
python run_tests.py azure
```

#### Run Individual Test Files

**AWS Tools:**
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_aws_tools
```

**GCP Tools:**
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_gcp_tools
```

**Azure Tools:**
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_azure_tools
```

#### Run Specific Test Methods
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_aws_tools.TestAWSTools.test_analyze_aws_disks_success
```

#### Run test cases for Specific cloud [aws, gcp, azure]
```bash
python run_tests.py aws
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

* **Success Scenarios**: Testing tool functionality with valid inputs and mocked cloud responses
* **Error Handling**: Testing graceful handling of API failures, authentication errors, and network issues
* **Parameter Validation**: Ensuring tools handle various input parameters correctly
* **Mock Integration**: Using mocked cloud SDK clients to avoid actual API calls during testing

### Test Structure

```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_aws_tools.py      # AWS FinOps tools tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_gcp_tools.py      # GCP FinOps tools tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_azure_tools.py    # Azure FinOps tools tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run_tests.py          # Test runner script
```

### Test Dependencies

Tests use the following mocking strategies:
- **AWS**: Mocks boto3 session and client methods
- **GCP**: Mocks Google Cloud client libraries and service methods
- **Azure**: Mocks Azure SDK clients and management operations

All tests are designed to run without requiring actual cloud credentials or making real API calls.
